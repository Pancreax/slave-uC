# Slave microcontroller for a SoC that runs linux #

This is a project of the firmware to a microcontroller intended to be slave of a SoC running linux. It is still in development, in the current state the only thing the microcontroller does is blinking a LED. But, the firmware already is structured to follow the architecture proposed on the [pre project](./doc/Pre_Project.md) file. I will write more details on following commits.
